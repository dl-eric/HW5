# HW5

All questions must use 2d arrays. All questions should be solved in the most efficient time possible.

## Documentation
Hashmaps here: https://github.com/CS196Illinois/Lecture-Notes/blob/master/hashmaps.md <\n>
Arrays here: https://github.com/CS196Illinois/Lecture-Notes/blob/master/python_LoopsAndArrays.md <\n>
2d Arrays here: https://github.com/CS196Illinois/Lecture-Notes/blob/master/2dArrays.md

## Testing
"python hw5_test.py" to run test cases.
Test cases are sparse, we don't cover most of the edge cases. If you want to get full points on the homework, make sure to think of edge cases and write tests for them yourself.

## Notes
Use good style!

## Bugs
As always, ping staff if you find a bug in the homework!
